# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the creation and execution of Test Suites in the QAF-Python framework instead of executing individual feature files. Test suites will be powered by the behave tagging system, allowing users to organize, group, and execute related test scenarios efficiently. This feature takes inspiration from QMetry's Test Runner system, adopting their approach of XML-based suite configuration, parallel execution capabilities, group-based test selection, and comprehensive reporting similar to how QAF framework manages BDD test execution with scenario directories and TestNG integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to create named test suites that group related feature files, so that I can organize my tests logically and execute them as cohesive units.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a test suite configuration THEN the system SHALL store the suite definition with a unique name
2. WHEN a test suite is defined THEN the system SHALL allow specification of multiple feature files to include
3. WHEN a test suite is created THEN the system SHALL validate that all specified feature files exist
4. IF a specified feature file does not exist THEN the system SHALL report an error with the missing file path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to use behave tags to define test suite membership, so that I can dynamically include or exclude scenarios based on their characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite is configured with include tags THEN the system SHALL execute only scenarios that match those tags
2. WHEN a test suite is configured with exclude tags THEN the system SHALL skip scenarios that match those tags
3. WHEN both include and exclude tags are specified THEN the system SHALL apply include filters first, then exclude filters
4. WHEN no tags are specified for a suite THEN the system SHALL execute all scenarios in the specified feature files
5. IF invalid tag syntax is provided THEN the system SHALL report a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to execute test suites using a command-line interface, so that I can integrate suite execution into my CI/CD pipelines and development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs a test suite command THEN the system SHALL execute all scenarios matching the suite criteria
2. WHEN a test suite execution completes THEN the system SHALL generate standard behave reports
3. WHEN a test suite name is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the suite exists before execution
4. IF a test suite does not exist THEN the system SHALL report an error with available suite names
5. WHEN suite execution fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to list and manage existing test suites, so that I can understand what suites are available and maintain them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to list test suites THEN the system SHALL display all configured suites with their descriptions
2. WHEN a user requests suite details THEN the system SHALL show included files, tags, and configuration options
3. WHEN a user deletes a test suite THEN the system SHALL remove the suite configuration
4. WHEN a user updates a test suite THEN the system SHALL validate the new configuration before saving
5. IF a suite configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL preserve the previous valid configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want test suites to support advanced execution options, so that I can customize test execution based on specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite execution is started THEN the system SHALL support parallel execution options
2. WHEN a test suite includes environment-specific tests THEN the system SHALL support environment parameter passing
3. WHEN a test suite execution encounters failures THEN the system SHALL support stop-on-first-failure configuration
4. WHEN a test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL support output format customization (JSON, HTML, XML)
5. WHEN a test suite runs THEN the system SHALL capture and aggregate execution metrics across all included scenarios

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want test suite configurations to be version-controlled and shareable, so that my team can collaborate effectively on test organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite is created THEN the system SHALL store the configuration in a version-controllable format
2. WHEN test suite configurations change THEN the system SHALL support configuration file validation
3. WHEN team members share suite configurations THEN the system SHALL resolve relative paths consistently
4. WHEN suite configurations are imported THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with the current framework version
5. IF a suite configuration has syntax errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with line numbers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want XML-based suite configuration similar to QAF's approach, so that I can leverage familiar configuration patterns and integrate with existing QMetry workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite is defined THEN the system SHALL support XML configuration format similar to QAF TestNG configuration
2. WHEN suite configuration specifies scenario directories THEN the system SHALL recursively include all feature files from those directories
3. WHEN multiple scenario file locations are specified THEN the system SHALL support semicolon-separated values like QAF's scenario.file.loc
4. WHEN suite configuration includes groups THEN the system SHALL execute only scenarios with matching behave tags
5. IF XML configuration is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed parsing error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want parallel execution capabilities inspired by QAF's approach, so that I can reduce execution time and improve test efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite is configured for parallel execution THEN the system SHALL support thread-safe test execution
2. WHEN parallel execution is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain separate browser sessions per thread
3. WHEN test suite specifies thread count THEN the system SHALL respect the configured parallelism level
4. WHEN parallel execution encounters failures THEN the system SHALL maintain proper test isolation
5. WHEN parallel execution completes THEN the system SHALL aggregate results from all threads

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want live reporting and dashboard capabilities similar to QAF, so that I can monitor test execution progress in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test suite execution starts THEN the system SHALL provide live execution dashboard
2. WHEN tests are executing THEN the system SHALL update execution status in real-time
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL capture and display screenshots immediately
4. WHEN execution is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow viewing partial results without waiting for completion
5. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive execution reports with detailed analysis

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want integration capabilities with CI/CD systems similar to QMetry's approach, so that I can seamlessly incorporate test suites into my deployment pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test suite execution completes THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration
2. WHEN test suite is executed in CI environment THEN the system SHALL support headless execution modes
3. WHEN test results are generated THEN the system SHALL support multiple export formats (JUnit XML, JSON, HTML)
4. WHEN test suite execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information for CI/CD systems
5. WHEN test suite includes environment-specific configuration THEN the system SHALL support environment parameter injection
